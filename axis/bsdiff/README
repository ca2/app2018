libbsddiff: Extracted from bsdiff-4.3 by Andrew Snow (andrew@modulus.org)
=========================================================================


libbsdiff aims to extract the functionality of the bsdiff utility into a
standalone C library.

This allows you to generate a patch between two blocks of data in memory,
into a 3rd block of memory, without touching the filesystem.


Generate a patch
----------------
 
The destination buffer for the patch must be preallocated and you pass in
the maximum size you've allocated and are willing to allow the patch to be.

The function returns the actual amount of memory used for the patch.

Upon errors (due to lack of memory), the function returns 0.

  #include "libbsdiff.h"
  patch_size = bsdiff(old_data, oldsize, new_data, newsize, patch, max_patchsize);



Apply a patch
-------------

A function is provider to let you find out the size of the patch target so
you know how much memory to allocate in advance.

Upon errors (due to corrupt or invalid patch), the function returns 0.


  patched_data = malloc( size_of_patched(patch) );
  result = bspatch(old_data, oldsize, patch, patch_size, patched_data);
